  "theory_content": "A limit describes the value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value. Limits are essential to calculus and are used to define continuity, derivatives, and integrals.\n\nFormal Definition:\nThe limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L, written as:\n  lim(x→a) f(x) = L\n\nif for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that:\n  0 < |x - a| < δ implies |f(x) - L| < ε\n\nKey Properties:\n1. Sum Rule: lim[f(x) + g(x)] = lim f(x) + lim g(x)\n2. Product Rule: lim[f(x) · g(x)] = lim f(x) · lim g(x)\n3. Quotient Rule: lim[f(x) / g(x)] = lim f(x) / lim g(x), provided lim g(x) ≠ 0",
